## General information

### Currency

USD and Khmer Riel (and a mix of them) are accepted. 100 USD banknote is often
useless in small shops and restaurants because changes are not always
available. Money exchanges are everywhere in the town. Some money exchanges
cheat you. Be careful. At Makers, USD is the only accepted currency.

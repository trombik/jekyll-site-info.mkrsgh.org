# Deployment

This document describes the deployment process.

When merged to `devel` branch, the files under `_site` generated by `jekyll`
will be copied to an `AWS` `S3` bucket. The bucket is configured to serve the
bucket files.

## Creating necessary resources in AWS

Before deploying, you need to create resources in AWS, such as a bucket, a
user, and ACLs. You need to do this once before initial deployment.

See `[_terraform](../_terraform)` for details..

## Configuration

The following GitHub Secrets must be set in the repository:

- `AWS_REGION`
- `S3_BUCKET_NAME`
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

The values are shown when you create necessary resources.

## Implementation

The deploy process is implemented with GitHub Actions
([.github/workflows/deploy.yml](../.github/workflows/deploy.yml)).

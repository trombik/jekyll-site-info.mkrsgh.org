      The BBC has unveiled the Micro:bit, the spiritual successor of the
      8-bit, beige-box BBC Micro released way back in 1981. To try and
      propel the Micro:bit to a comparable echelon of usefulness and
      ubiquity—about 80 percent of British schools had at least one BBC
      Micro—the BBC will give a Micro:bit to every child in Year 7 (ages
      11-12) across the UK, for free.

      With the help of the British Council, teachers in the Western Balkans
      region are discovering a new way to reach disengaged students. A project
      aiming to equip 1 million young people with the skills they need to
      compete in the global labour market has shown that hard-to-reach
      children are often inspired by the micro:bit.

      Denmark’s ultra:bit project, is offering prizes to children aged 9-12
      for the best idea and best solution.

## Introduction

At _Makers_, I am going to provide classroom sessions for kids and students,
focusing on a small, cool device developed by BBC, called _BBC micro:bit_.
This is a part of my project ([the project
proposal](../../../../blog/2020/06/28/Project-Proposal-The-First-Makerspace-in-Siem-Reap/)).

{% youtube "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNLf6aFYVoU" %}

[Wikipedia describes micro:bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Bit) as

> an open source hardware ARM-based embedded system designed by the BBC for
> use in computer education in the UK

The hardware is designed for Science, Technology, Engineering, and
Mathematics, or STEM in short. The device has interfaces for easy access, two
microcomputers, a motion sensor, a magnetometer sensor, push-buttons, and an
LED matrix screen.

It is a standalone device that kids, and adults alike, play, experiment, and
develop _products_. Unlike traditional development boards, micro:bit doesn't
require additional hardware, expertise, or programming development environment
on your computer. You just need a micro:bit and a computer.

## BBC micro:bit in UK

Many British kids are familiar with micro:bit because the board is widely used
in classrooms in UK.

{% include feature_row id="feature_row1" type="left" %}

The hardware design is open-sourced, which allows any vendor to make their
own micro:bit for use in education. There are dozens of vendors that
manufacture their version of micro:bit in the market. They also sell
adopters, peripherals, and starter kits of micro:bit.

Since then, the board has been popular in classrooms because the project "_was
not working with the government to incorporate the Micro:bit into the national
curriculum, but instead was creating resources for teachers, parents and
pupils to access from its own website_". The official project website provides
not only [projects for kids](https://microbit.org/projects/), but [an online
classroom management service](https://classroom.microbit.org/), and [lessons
and lesson plans](https://microbit.org/lessons/) for teachers.

## BBC micro:bit in the world

micro:bit is popular not only in UK. [BBC micro:bit in
school](https://microbit.org/get-started/bbc-microbit-in-school/) claims that
there are _"4.5 million micro:bit devices in 60 countries"_.

{% include feature_row id="feature_row3" type="left" %}

Thanks to its open-source license, micro:bit is available from many vendors
around the world, so the teachers can easily buy, experiment, and evaluate its
possibilities in their classroom. [MakeCode](https://makecode.microbit.org/),
an online development service provided by Microsoft, makes it possible to
teach online even without a physical micro:bit. The service has a simulator,
which runs the code in a browser, and kids can watch the behaviour of their
code in the browser. You do not need any prior knowledge of micro:bit, or
programming, either.

If you are a teacher have a look at
[Emotion badge](https://microbit.org/projects/make-it-code-it/emotion-badge/)
project, one of many available projects, to see how students learn.

## If you are interested, join us and support the project

As a parent, you probably need something to throw at your kids to play with.
_Makers_ will provide micro:bit, help and assistant to teachers, and a space
for the classrooms. If you are interested, please support the project! The
project needs:

- laptops, at least five (second-handed one in good condition costs USD 200 - 300)
- chairs and desks for kids
- a community (you)

Are you a teacher? Do you want to teach modern technologies in interesting
ways? I need your help (and I can help you, too).

## About the Makerspace

Established in 2020, the year of Covid-19, we established Makers in Siem Reap,
Cambodia. It is a place to hack code, develop products, and learn technology.

## What we do at Makers

The Makerspace at Makers is a lab and a factory for our own projects. We do
corroborate with local business owners, helping them develop their products at
Makers. The idea of Makerspace, or Maker movement, is too new in Cambodia.
Local residents, expats included, do not know what it is. Technology is all
about smartphones and SNS. Few own a computer. There are some definitions of
Makerspace, but you need some contexts and background knowledge of technology
to understand the definitions. In these circumstances, we need to show them
what we do, and what they can do, at a Makerspace. The Makerspace is a
showcase of our solutions, products, and what you can do at Makers. The
products and solutions are for our own problems in tourism and guesthouse
business.

We assist creative people, and help those who help themselves by learning. We
help them by teaching technologies and showing possible solutions to inspire
creativeness in them.

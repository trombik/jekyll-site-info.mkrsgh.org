## Develop Design Thinking at makerspace

Also known as _engineering_, Design Thinking is a method to solve a problem.
Unlike traditional education where teachers transfer knowledge first, the
students then apply the knowledge to solve problems, Design Thinking requires
students to find problems, and learn new things to solve the problem. Design
Thinking gives students incentives to learn more. It is an iterative process
to:

- find a problem,
- understand the problem,
- analyse the problem,
- define requirements of possible solution,
- learn new things to solve the problem
- design the solution,
- prototype the solution,
- and test the solution.

You need many iterations to complete your solution. During the cycles, you
will find wrong assumptions, incomplete analysis, defects in the design, and
misapplication of your knowledge. The process itself is the learning process.

Albert Einstein said it correctly:

> "Anyone who has never made a mistake, never tried anything new"

You cannot make something new without failing first.
Developing a product or a solution is a cycle of failures.

for Educators](https://designthinkingforeducators.com/) for additional

We are not, in any way, educators, but we can help educators to design their
education programs, provide spaces, tools and materials. We can introduce web
services and applications designed for kids and/or students.

## We care about safety at Makers

Safety is the last thing to implement in this country, if ever. We implement
security controls for safety as reasonably as possible. We require members to
take courses which include security instructions, and safety practices before
using certain tools, machines, and works. We have [safety
guidelines](../safety) and [a list of tools and machines](../tools) that
require safety clearance.

Please [contact us](https://t.me/mkrsgh) for more information.

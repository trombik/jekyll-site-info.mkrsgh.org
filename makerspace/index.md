      A makerspace is a collaborative work space inside a school, library or
      separate public/private facility for making, learning, exploring and
      sharing that uses high tech to no tech tools.  These spaces are open to
      kids, adults, and entrepreneurs and have a variety of maker equipment
      including 3D printers, laser cutters, cnc machines, soldering irons and
      even sewing machines.

      STEM skills are extremely important in the Digital Era
    text: |
      STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. Skills
      related to these are critical to problem-solving, innovation, and
      creativity. Designers, builders, and tinkerers, or individuals who
      create <em>things</em> with these skills, are called <em>"makers"</em>.
      Makers Siem Reap is the first <em>makerspace</em> in Siem Reap, where
      <em>Makers</em> design products, realize their ideas, and learn STEM
      skills.

    title: Develop Design Thinking
    text: |
      Also known as engineering, Design Thinking is a method to solve a
      problem. Unlike traditional education where teachers transfer knowledge
      first, the students then apply the knowledge to solve problems, Design
      Thinking requires students to find problems, and learn new things to
      solve the problem.

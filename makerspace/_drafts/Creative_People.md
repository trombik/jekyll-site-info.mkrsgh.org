Kids inherit wealth or poverty from parents. How about creativities?
Biologically, maybe at some level. Probably, negligible. Recent researches
revealed that people inherit _creative potential_, but that does not guarantee
actual performance, or results. Environmental factors must be playing the major
role. Mozart became the greatest composer in history not because his father is
a violinist, but because the father gave him the best possible education in
music at the time. Not all parents are fortunate in having such options to
kids. But you are not raising another Mozart, are you? There are always
things parents can do for kids.

My neighbour, Simon and Katrine, the owners of [Babel
Guesthouse](https://www.babelsiemreap.com/), have daughters. A few days ago,
it was the birthday of their daughter. In the morning on that festive day, the
mother showed me pictures of her gifts to the kid.

They built a small ice cream shop in a room. Look at the details. A small
kitchen, cooking utensils, and a signboard. They even installed a PoS system.
No compromise. God is in the details.

Their product, an ice cream shop, shows exactly what creative people can do.
In this country, options are always limited. No Toys"R"Us. Very few craft
stores. They used whatever available in the town.

I did not see how they built, but I can guess their product development
process (yes, what they did was _product development_). They must have wanted
to give something unique to the daughter, which would be remembered in her
whole life.

They empathized user's need (the daughter, in this case). What does her daughter
loves? They did not ask her. Asking users what they want is often a bad
idea in product development. Most of people often request what, _they think_,
they need, which is not necessarily the solution to the problem. If you asked
someone in the 18th century what they need, they would have said they need a
faster horse, not a car. Anyway, the parents identified the problem by
defining a problem statement; "as a kid, I would like to enjoy the experience
in an ice cream shop, buying an ice cream, paying money for it, and tasting it
so that I can enjoy my birthday with my friends, and remember the day as one
of the best birthday in my life". This is called "user stories" in software
development. A user story is used to describe the problem from the users'
perspective to clarify and simplify the requirement.

Next, the parents created the ideas to solve the problem. What is necessary
for that experience?  A counter to order ice creams. A signboard to welcome
customers. A kitchen with cooking utensils. Payment must be part of the
experience, too. Lastly, as the user is a kid, the shop must be cute! This is
called "Ideate" stage.

They now have ideas. Are they available in the town? Some are available,
others are not. Maybe something else can be re-used? Let's see what is
available at local shops. You cannot order a real signboard for this purpose.
Let's make one as paints are not very expensive. In product development, we
call this a "Prototype" stage.

The last stage is "Test". No, you cannot test your solution in this case. You
do not want to spoil a kid's chance of surprise on the birthday. As such, your
test must be performed on the live system, i.e. the birthday party. You cannot
redesign, or improve your solution this time, but maybe next year? I'm sure
that they will surprise kids with different solutions, and they will continue
doing so. This is called "Iteration".

During the process, they must have learnt many things. What kind of paints
should be used for the signboard? To make it realistic, but cute at the same
time, what should be placed? These are just my guesses but there must have been
many challenges and findings. They learnt not because they were told to do so.
They had a problem to solve, and they learnt to solve the problem. In this
process, learning is not a goal, but a method to solve problems. Learning
something by actively getting involved in problem-solving is called "Active
Learning". They are not forced to learn but are given strong incentives to
learn.

This is actually what _makers_ are doing in their projects, knowingly or
unknowingly. The terms described in this story are theorized in industrial
product development and software development, and the theory is actively being
used in STEM &mdash; science, technology, engineering and mathematics
&mdash; education programs. [The BBC micro:bit course]({{
"makerspace/courses/Microbit_Basic" | relative_url }}) and [other courses]({{
"/makerspace/courses" | relative_url }}) for beginners at "Makers" are aimed
at providing this kind of development process, and opportunities to solve
problems.  Do you like the idea? If you do, please [support the
project](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/trombik/1274353640?ref=4wrsfe&token=4bdafeb9).
The kickstarter project is currently under review. We will publish the updates
about the project in the blog soon.

Be creative to raise creative kids. You do not have to be rich for that. Money
can solve certain types of problems, but creativity can do a lot more than
money.  I do not know what the result will be in the kids' life. Probably, the
products the parents built for kids, their attitude towards problem-solving,
and kids' experience on their birthday, will make them creative for sure. When
the two daughters are old enough to be able to understand the problems their
parents have solved, the daughters will appreciate the efforts and understand
why they did. These are certainly the greatest gifts to their daughters.

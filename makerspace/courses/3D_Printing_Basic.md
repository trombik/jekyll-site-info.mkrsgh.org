In the 3D Printing Basic course, you will print a 3D solid model from publicly
available STL files. You will learn how 3D printer works, materials and
filaments, calibration techniques, and fine-tuning printer settings.

After successful completion of the course assignment, you will receive
_3D_ [badge](../../badges/).

The course does not include 3D model design. To design 3D models, we have [3D
CAD Basic](../3D_CAD_Basic) course.

The class takes 2 hours including a 10 minutes break.

## Target

The course is suitable for anyone who are interested in 3D printing with no
experience in the past.

Even if you don't know how to design 3D models, you can enjoy 3D printing
without designing anything.

## Prerequisites

Participants must be over 14 years.

### Course objectives

Upon completion of the course, participants will:

- be able to print publicly available 3D model data on Internet, such as
  [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/)

### Course materials

In the course, the following materials are used.

- A computer
- A 3D printer

All materials are provided.

In this lesson, you will ensure that you had fully understood the Ohm's law.

## Resistors in series and parallel

When:

* $ V $ = 10 V
* $ R_{1} $ = 10 ohm
* $ R_{2} $ = 20 ohm
* $ R_{3} $ = 40 ohm

What is $ I_{2} $, the current  flowing through $ R_{2} $?

## Hints

* Solve the total resistance of $ R_{2} $ and $ R_{3} $, $ R_{2and3} $ first.
* Total resistance is $ R_{total} = R_{1} + R_{2and3} $.

In this lesson, you will learn to use your multimeter as we discuss the
physics behind electronics, meet several infamous circuit components (like
resistors and LEDs), and work together to build and analyze useful common
circuits using real hardware.

This lesson is a workshop, based on "Electronics - Level 1 Simple Circuits &
Measurements Fundamentals", which is kindly provided by [University of Colorado
Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/). After the workshop, you will learn more
details in [other lessons](#other-lessons).

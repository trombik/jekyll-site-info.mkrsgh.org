In this lesson, you will learn the Ohm's law, which is the formula of
electronics that you will find everywhere.

## The Ohm's law

The below is a simple resistor circuit with a battery.

<img src="../ohms-law.svg" class="mx-auto w-50 img-fluid d-block" alt="The Ohm's law">

$$ V $$ is voltage in Volt (V). $$ I $$ is current in Ampere (A). $$ R $$ is resistor value in Ohm (ohm).

$$ V = I \times R $$

$$ R = { V \over I } $$

$$ I = { V \over R } $$

When the current is 1 A, and the resistor is 2 ohm, the voltage is;

$$ V = I \times R = 1 A \times 2 ohm = 2 (V) $$

When the voltage is 5 V, and the current is 500 mA (0.5 A), the resistor is:

$$ R = { V \over I } = { 5V \over 500 mA } = 10 (ohm) $$

When the voltage is 5 V, and the resistor is 2 ohm, the current is;

$$ I = { V \over R } = { 5 V \over 2 ohm } = 2.5 (A) $$

## Power equation

Power is an amount of work. For example, a 1,000 W fan does two times more work
than 500 W fan, i.e. it makes more flow of wind.

$$ P (W) = V \times I = ( I \times R ) \times I = I^2 \times R $$

In the Blink course, you will create a _blink_ circuit, controlled by a
microcomputer. The blink circuit is the first circuit electronics beginners
creates. The circuit simply _blink_ an LED in the circuit. You will learn
basic programming by `arduino`, a computer language for beginners.

After successful completion of the course assignment, you will receive
_Blink_ [badge](../../badges/).

The class takes 2 hours including a 10 minutes break.

title: Oscilloscope course

---

## Description

In the Oscilloscope course, you will learn basics of oscilloscope, why you
need it, and how to visualize signals in a circuit. The course is designed for
those who have experiences in building simple circuits.

Oscilloscope is a device that visualize electronic signals.

After successful completion of the course assignment, you will receive
_Oscillo_ [badge](../../badges/).

The class takes 3 hours including two 10 minutes breaks.

## Target

The course is suitable for those who:

- want debug circuits
- are considering buying a oscilloscope

## Prerequisites

Participants must be over 14 years.

Participants must have basic understanding of electronics, such as:

- Relations of voltage, current, and power
- How passive components, resistors, capacitors, and diodes, work

Participants must have created a circuit with microcomputer that blinks an
LED. For blink circuit, we have [Blink course](../Blink/). You are encouraged
to take Blink course before this course.

### Course objectives

Upon completion of the course, participants will:

- be able to visualize signals
- be able to trigger by rising and falling signals

### Course materials

In the course, the following materials are used.

- An oscilloscope
- A circuit

All materials are provided.

### Topics covered in the course

- Understanding signals
- Hazards and risks
- Digital and analog oscilloscopes
- Common functions in oscilloscopes
- Triggers
- Visualizing the Blink

### Assignment

Participants will demonstrate their achievements by configuring the
oscilloscope with different triggers.

### Pricing

20 USD

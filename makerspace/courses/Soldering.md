## Description

In the Soldering course, we discuss hand soldering, one of the most important
skill in electronics. It starts with a theory in solder, and soldering.

You will learn soldering passive components, transistors, and pin headers.

During the course, you will solder a circuit, which you can bring back to home
with you.

The course does not include programming microcomputer. If you want to learn
programming with microcomputer, join [Blink course](../Blink/).

After successful completion of the course assignment, you will receive
_Soldering_ [badge](../../badges/).

The class takes 2 hours including a 10 minutes break.

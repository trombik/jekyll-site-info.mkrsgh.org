In the Ethernet wiring course, you will learn different types of Ethernet
cables and RJ45 connectors, physical characteristics, and how to wire Ethernet
cables.

While WiFi networks are ubiquitous these days, you still need wired networks
because Ethernet is:

- Simple
- Performant
- Reliable and less error-prone

When you install WiFi Access Point, or simply AP, you often need to wire APs
and your upstream access line to ISP's network.

After successful completion of the course assignment, you will be able to make
Ethernet cables, and will receive _L1_ [badge](../../badges/).

The class takes 2 hours including a 10 minutes break.

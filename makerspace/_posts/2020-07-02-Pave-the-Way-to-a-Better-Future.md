Wat Bo, on the east side of the Siem Reap River, where our property is
located, is a quiet, cosy area in Siem Reap.  Close enough to the Pub Street,
far from the noise of night parties. It has been known as a residential area,
where ex-pats often choose as their place to live. Quiet, green, and less
traffic.

Siem Reap, as well as the country, has been changing. Many infrastructure
projects, despite the impact of the pandemic, are going on. Wat Bo is not an
exception. Recently, _before_ the pandemic, many businesses were opening by
major streets in the Wat Bo area. Residents feared that the area would
become another touristic area, like an area around the Pub Street.

In front of our property, we have an alley, one end to a wider road, and
another to nothing. The alley is so narrow that, at night, tuk-tuk drivers
might miss the alley.  When it is raining, the alley is flooded, and becomes
very muddy.  Traffic was little or nothing. Neighbours let their kids playing
on the alley without fear of a traffic accident. Probably not in the future.

## A development begins

This morning, I was in my room when a young lady visited the property. She is
a daughter of my landlord. She drove a car with her mother and brother from
Phnom Penh, the capital of the country. They came here to talk to government
officials. The government will widen the alley, and build a new road. The
landowners by the road will give up some spaces for the road without
compensation. Good news, or bad? For some business owners, they like the quiet
atmosphere. Others welcome the news, hoping the new road will attract more
tourists, and business. We have another street in the back, which is one of
the major streets in the area. Hopefully, that street will remain the main
street.

"I've never seen the alley is so crowded", said one of my neighbours. The
government officials and engineers surveyed the alley, and answered
questions from residents. People kindly translated the answers for me. Like
any other places in the region, things will not be clear until the last
minute. I will take the plan and the answers with a "grain" of salt. We will
see. Anyway, I cannot do anything with it.

According to my observations in other areas of the town, they usually pave
roads, and replace the water system under the ground, which gives residents
better access to water. Two, or three-storied houses usually have water
reservoirs on the top floor because the pressure is not strong enough to pump
the water to the top. With newer water pipes, the pressure can be increased.
A great improvement for locals.

People fear changes a bit, but generally, they are very hopeful. The country
is a poor country. Many problems here and there. Still, people are positive
for the future.

The country had been in war for too long. They deserve a better future.

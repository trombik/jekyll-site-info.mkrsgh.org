Finally, we have a kitchen at Makers, Siem Reap. It is an open-air, shared
kitchen at our garden. We needs more for it, but at least, you can make simple
foods, coffee, and cocktails.

One of staff members from Babel Guesthouse almost made it, and a neighbor
finished it.

Cambodian people is very good at making these things: welding, plumbing, and
molding concrete. It looks like a family or a household has at least one in
the member, who has these skills. One day, I will learn the basics &mdash;
especially welding &mdash; but until then, they are completely new to me.

I am trying to open [a makerspace here in Siem Reap](/makerspace/), where
tools and equipment are provided for makers, who create _things_. I would like
to introduce one of my subprojects at the makerspace, STEM education program
with BBC micro:bit for kids ages 6 through 12. I would like to give a talk
about the project to parents in Siem Reap.

STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. It
typically refers to curriculum choices in schools to improve competitiveness
in science and technology.

BBC micro:bit is an educational electronic device, developed by BBC, for STEM
education. Since its release in 2015, the device has been widely used in UK
thanks to BBC who distributed the devices for free to a million of pupils in
UK.

Britons, Singaporean, and other European citizens probably know STEM and
micro:bit well as pupils in the countries are already using micro:bit in
schools. People from other countries might need a bit of explanation because
the idea and the concept _sound_ new. I would like to explain why your kids
need STEM, and what STEM aims at, and -- if you like the idea -- how you can
help the project.

If you are curious about STEM and the project, [here is a very introductory
post](http://info.mkrsgh.org/blog/makerspace/2020/06/30/Microbit-Courses/)
I wrote sometime ago.

The talk will focus on the concept of STEM, problems your kids will face, and
what pupils will learn in STEM education programs. If you know STEM well, the
topics might sound too familiar, but I will explain the problems from
different point of view, specifically, as an IT engineer. Hope you will find
it fun.

If you think kids deserve a better, modern educational program, have
difficulties in the current situation around kids, or need something to throw
at your kids to play with, please come and join to the talk. Teachers,
professional educators, and those who know someone in education, are very
welcome, too.

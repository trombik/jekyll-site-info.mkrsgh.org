Like other makers in the world, we rely on
[AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/). In South East Asian countries,
Chinese suppliers are often the only option to buy gadgets, supplies and
consumables. The orders made in early Feb arrived at Siem Reap after four
month, which is the longest delivery time in my past orders. A week ago, I
ordered [PoE splitters](https://community.fs.com/blog/what-is-poe-splitter-and-how-does-it-work.html),
some development boards, and [a machine](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000614905844.html),
and chose FedEx and DHL as shipment options. Usually, shops offer AliExpress
Standard Shipping as an option, but this time, some shops did not. Even when
they did, the shipping fee was more expensive than usual. In customers
reviews, there were lucky customers and unlucky ones. Even if you choose
express delivery service, there were possibilities of delays.

When I asked an officer at GPO in Siem Reap last month, he laughed when he saw
my tracking number starting with `SG`, which means the item was handled by
Singapore Post. "Nothing from Singapore this month", he said.

Luckily, DHL sent an SMS message to me today that one of the items had
delivered to its local office. No custom tax, no problem. Just two days after
the pickup as promised. Other items are on the way. It appears that logistics
are recovering.

I checked some items on AliExpress, and it appears that shops now default to
AliExpress Standard Shipping again. One of the reasons to choose AliExpress
Standard Shipping is that, when an item is not delivered, you do not have to
dispute with the shop. AliExpress support directly processes the dispute, and
the refund immediately starts when the dispute reason has been proved to be
valid.

One of my orders includes a dozen of BBC micro:bit development boards, which I
am [planning to use them in classrooms]({{
"/blog/makerspace/2020/06/30/Microbit-Courses/" | relative_url }}). Some
ex-pats know what it is, but others do not. When they see it, hopefully, they
will understand why the board is great for STEM education.

The next time I order something I do not need immediately, I will try
AliExpress Standard Shipping. We will see.

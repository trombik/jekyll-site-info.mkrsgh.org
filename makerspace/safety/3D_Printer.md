## Risks

### Electric shocks kill you

The machine is powered by AC main. The power supply unit is capable to source
enough current to kill you.

### You will get burnt by accidentally touching hot surfaces

3D printers have hot surfaces which can lead to skin injury. These surfaces
include the nozzle and the heat plate.

### Plastic can catch fire

Plastic is flammable and the nozzle heats plastic filaments.

### Fumes are toxic

Some materials, notably ABS, are known to cause health issues.

## Safety practices

Read the printer manual and follow the instructions.

Check the machine is clean and in a good condition. Specifically:

- Power cables is not damaged
- No sign of fire, or smoke, around the power supply unit

Ensure the area you work has adequate air supply and ventilation.

Always power off the machine when:

- you finish the work
- you clean or maintain parts of the machine

Use safe materials. PLA, often made from natural materials, is less toxic.

Wear eye protection goggles.

Wear heat-resistant gloves when touching the nozzle.

Never touch the operating machine.

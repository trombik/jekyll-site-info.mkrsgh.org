summary: |
  Safety is a critical part of making things. Most tools are dangerous, and
  others are lethal. Makerspace users of all ages need to be trained in safely
  operating tools before using them.

Safety is one of the _first_ thing you must master at Makers. We do our best
to prevent accidents, but the last defence line is you.
